# Uber-2.0
Uber 2.0 is an Uber clone app that uses Firebase as the backend service. This app not only mimics Uber in functionality, but also pays close attention to user experience by building the UI with custom view subclasses and animations. Users will be able to authenticate as the passenger or driver and will be able to request or accept rides respectively. Real time location tracking and data storage will also be available.
